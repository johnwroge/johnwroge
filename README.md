# John Wroge

Hi, I'm John, a software engineer who builds systems across the stack. I work on infrastructure tooling, web applications, and developer experiences that help teams ship better software faster.

I’m particularly interested in making complex systems more accessible through better abstractions, clearer interfaces, and AI-assisted workflows.
