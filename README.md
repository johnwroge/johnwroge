# John Wroge

I'm a software engineer who builds systems across the stack. I work on infrastructure tooling, web applications, and developer experiences that help teams ship better software.

I'm interested in making complex systems more accessible through better abstractions, clearer interfaces, and AI-assisted workflows. My recent projects include Kubernetes operators, natural language query systems, and machine learning applications.

I contribute to open source projects, write about technical topics, and enjoy working on problems that sit at the intersection of different domains.
